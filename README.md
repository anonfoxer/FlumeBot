# Version 2.5.0
Changes: 
- Added &shark and &hamster
- Added the Mordhau command category.
- General performance optimizations.

Currently known issues:
- Some action commands may throw an empty message.
- pixabay-api is severely outdated with 2 possible vulnerabilities but is currently in use due to its compliance with v12. Any suggestions to improve this with an easy to use API would be greatly appreciated.
