# Version 2.5.2
Changes: 
- Changed descriptions for Mordhau command embeds.
- Added the ability for the bot to tease you for editing a message (thank you, DriftingNitro)
- Fixed a rare crash from members joining a server while the bot is active.
- Updated &info for 3.0 announcement
- Added new strats to &haustrat

Currently known issues:
- Some action commands may throw an empty message.
- pixabay-api is severely outdated with 2 possible vulnerabilities but is currently in use due to its compliance with v12. Any suggestions to improve this with an easy to use API would be greatly appreciated.
- The bot will trigger the edit tease on ANY message update, encluding some embeds.
