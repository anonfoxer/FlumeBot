# Version 2.5.1
Changes: 
- Added embeds to messages where appropriate.
- Added &haustrat
- Removed tenacious and friendly perks from &badbuild
- Removed broken message.author() calls to prevent errors with the new version of discord.js

Currently known issues:
- Some action commands may throw an empty message.
- pixabay-api is severely outdated with 2 possible vulnerabilities but is currently in use due to its compliance with v12. Any suggestions to improve this with an easy to use API would be greatly appreciated.


# Node Setup
- npm init
- npm i --save discord.js
- npm i --save https://github.com/discordjs/Commando.git
- npm i --save pixabay-api


# To Do List
- More fun stupid shit
- More weird hacky code
- Voice Channel Control

# Add Bot to a server
