# FlumeBot
My first properly done public discord bot
Also an excuse for me to learn how to use git right.
Now running 24/7!


# Version 2.0.0
To celebrate me getting this stupid thing on an RPi, I've changed some things and we are now on what I think is safe to say Flume 2.0!
Changes:
- Removed garbage code/failed projects from the entry. This includes logging and raidmode functions.
- Added change notes to the Entry Point.
- Added &cat, &kick, &ban, &rip
- Removed Setup group
- Removed &mute, &unmute.


# Node Setup

# To Do List
